# Overview

This game is a simple platformer game with a character, a map and collectable coins. I wrote this game to try my hand at game developement with pygame. I intend to continue developing this game until I can make the game unique and marketable.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
