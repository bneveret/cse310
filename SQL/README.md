# Overview

This program is one for taking attendance.Using SQL databases I made it possible to add and remove students from the role, and take attendance.

In my busy schedule I was able to find 3 days to work on this. The purpose of this code was to see how far I could get with SQL in that time frame having never learned about it previously.
